## What does our code need to know, decide, and do?

- send an email, A
- read subscribers from the database, A
- rank of each coupon, D
- the number of recommendations sent per each email address, D
- the number of recommendations that qualify a person for the best coupons, D
- a list of the best coupons, C
- a list of the good coupons, C
- compute a list of persons to receive the best coupons, C
- compute a list of persons to receive good coupons, C 
- the address of the cloud email service

### Answers I didn't have:
- reading the coupons from the database (I suppose that's hidden in my answer of a 'a list of the best coupons')
- the subject of the email
- body of the email
- an email address
- deciding which email someone gets 
- a subscriber record
- a coupon record


## Categorise these into ACD (Actions, Calculations, Data):
- Send an email A (1)   // example
- Read subscribers from the database, A // side-effect: it matters when you read from db
- The ranking of each coupon, D // this a fact about the coupon (that would be read from the db)
- Reading the coupons from the database, A // side-effect: matters when you read from the db
- The subject of the email, D // 
- An email address, D
- A recommendation count, D
- Deciding which email someone gets, C // calculation: makes a decision using a predicate on the recommendation count
- A subscriber record, D
- A coupon record, D
- A list of coupon records, D
- A list of subscriber records, D
- The body of the email, D
